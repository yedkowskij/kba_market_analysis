After the vehicle has been in use for a longer period of time, the high voltage battery housing could therefore corrode under certain specific environmental conditions. In this case, the sealing effect of the battery housing could then gradually be compromised, allowing moisture to penetrate the battery. This could lead to insulation failure, resulting in it being impossible to restart the vehicle once the engine has been switched off. Furthermore, this could increase the risk of fire.;;"Type of economic operator taking notified measure(s): Manufacturer

Punctures and the trailer's incorrect shape types, weights and centre of gravity can lead to a loss of traction. Moreover, the coupling can be overloaded, increasing the risk of trailer detachment. Additionally, rear underrun may not be applied or sharp parts can be extending backwards. Furthermore, some axles are undersized and mass data is uncertified. This can lead the axle/suspension part(s) to break under load. Finally, incorrectly applied weights can cause ineffective brake performance.
